# Welcome to The Art of Web dojo

This dojo aims to teach you about web-based vulnerabilities, which you usually see in CTFs. We created this dojo to fill the web content void that pwn.college doesn't offer.

Most modules go from easy to complex challenges with a generous amount of hints; however, if you want to earn the badge, you must prove yourself worthy with the `Web Application Security` module.

Good luck.

This dojo is open source!
